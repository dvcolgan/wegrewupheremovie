    <p>A musician struggling to cope with his split from his lover and muse begins to suspect his past is being erased in this unnerving film starring members of Chicago band, Paper Thick Walls. As songs Liam and Lauren recorded together disappear from tapes and mutual friends deny they know him, Liam hits the road on a desperate journey to prove to himself and everyone else he's not insane—that the life his that they built together, and that he threw away, was real.</p>
